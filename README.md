## Project: Image Packing on PDF

This project implements a Python program to arrange a set of images of random sizes and shapes into a PDF, minimizing the total space used while preserving each image's original aspect ratio.

### Project Structure

The final project structure should look like this:

```
/learn-basics-image-packing
├── input_images/              # Input images generated by sample_data_generation.py
├── output.pdf                 # The generated output file (final result)
├── sample_data_generation.py  # Script to create random images
├── task_1_starter_code.py     # Main implementation file (packing logic goes here)
└── requirements.txt           # Project dependencies
```

-----

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup and Dependencies

1.  Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

    ```bash
    # Create the environment (in the project root directory)
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the environment (Windows - Command Prompt)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    # Activate the environment (macOS/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  Install Dependencies:
    Install the required libraries (`pillow`, `reportlab`, etc.) using the provided file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 2. Data Generation

Run the script to create 50 sample images with random shapes and transparent backgrounds in the `input_images/` folder:

```bash
python sample_data_generation.py
```

-----

## Running the Program

The core logic resides in `task_1_starter_code.py`.

### 1. Implementation Note

The `task_1_starter_code.py` file contains the logic for:

  * Image Preprocessing: Cropping images to the visible content area while maintaining aspect ratio.
  * PDF Generation: Using ReportLab's robust `ImageReader` to prevent PDF corruption.
  * Simple Placement (To be replaced): A basic row-by-row layout has been implemented to verify the PDF generation works.

To complete the task, you must replace the "Simple Placement Logic" in `task_1_starter_code.py` with an efficient 2D Rectangle Packing Algorithm to minimize wasted space.

### 2. Execution

Execute the main program to generate the packed PDF:

```bash
python task_1_starter_code.py
```

### 3. Verification

The script will generate `output.pdf` in the project root directory. Open this file to view the packed images.

## Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

The following packages are necessary to run the program:

```
charset-normalizer==3.4.4
pillow==12.0.0
reportlab==4.4.4
```

-----

## Bonus Goals (Future Work)

1.  Optimize Image Compression: Implement logic (e.g., in the `compress_images` function) to reduce the file size of the images before they are placed in the PDF.
2.  Implement a Command-Line Interface (CLI): Use Python's `argparse` module to allow users to specify input/output paths, page size (A4/Letter), and other configurations via the command line.
3.  Add Documentation: Include detailed docstrings for all functions, explaining parameters, returns, and core logic.
4.  Implement Error Handling: Add checks for missing input files, invalid file types, and handle exceptions gracefully.
